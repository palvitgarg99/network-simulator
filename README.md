# network-simulator
# The program starts from main.cpp
# The input.txt file contains the inputs provided to the program.
# To run the program just compile main.cpp file and run it.
# The nomenclature is used in such a way that you can easily understand the code.
# The Algorithm used is Dijkistra(I can also use floyd-warshal if i have given the network has become stable and 	no more user and friendship will be added).
# The users are added in a linklist because here database connectivity is not provided,so most appropriate data structure to add  a user list is linklist.
# To unfriend a user you can set bool value to false or 0.
# The input format used is
 ---firstly total number of operations are given(we may put it in infinite loop too).
 ---for each operation
 	->press 1 for adding new user.
 	->press 2 for adding new friendship.
 	->press 3 to find whether network is fully connected.
 	->press 4 to find degree of friendship betwen two friends.
