# network-simulator
 The program starts from main.cpp
 The input.txt file contains the inputs provided to the program.
 To run the program just compile main.cpp file and run it.
 The nomenclature is used in such a way that you can easily understand the code.
 The Algorithm used is Dijkistra(I can also use floyd-warshal if i have given the network has become stable and 	no more user and friendship will be added).
 The users are added in a linklist because here database connectivity is not provided,so most appropriate data structure to add   a user list is linklist.
 To unfriend a user you can set bool value to false or 0.
# The input format used is
 1)firstly total number of operations are given(we may put it in infinite loop too).
 2)for each operation
 	->press 1 for adding new user.
 	->press 2 for adding new friendship.
 	->press 3 to find whether network is fully connected.
 	->press 4 to find degree of friendship betwen two friends.
